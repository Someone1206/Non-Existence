The calculator can cause a number of diseases from 'Brain Aches' to brain cancer, epilepsy, death of 98.569% of your neurons (but certainly not AIDS or any other STIs i.e. [if you know what I mean]).  
### Use it at your own risk...  

Please stay atleast a meter away from your screen/monitor cuz you may be tempted to punch it(***xactly how Armin punched Eren in s4 ep14 [Yeah the monitor won't be able to punch you back like Eren did cuz it probably won't exist by then])***  

**If you experience any if these symptoms then immediately delete this file from your drive. You should also consider resetting your pc, with 'Remove everything and reinstall Windows' and erasing your data thoroughly (only for Windows. Idk for mac and linux),  
OR  
You may fully and completely reformat your drive if you don't know how to reset your os.**  

#### ***No responsibility will be taken by anyone involved in developing this product if you are harmed, cuz you were and are WARNED.***  

***The latest releases are provided cuz it's a pain to compile the files once again. They were created in Win x32 and linux x64. So you can get the src and compile it for ur pc if on linux x32 or mac***  

a mac is far out of my reach. Can't even set a virtual machine...

this ain't a goddamn virus, Win10 says its a virus (ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­) but it's completely safe.


Its sadðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
