### ***I hate java as it treats everything(literally everthing[even me, no matter how stupid and useless I may be but I am atleast not a mere object, neither are you]) as objects and every thing is too uselessly(less useless than me) damn long to write.***

Please help me make it the most efficient way of printing Hewwo World. It currently needs 12gb ram, I guess, as java -Xmx12288m Hewwo.java gives no error and m stands for mb(I am still guessing). I could never run it. My pc has 4GB RAM and Win10, therefore, I have 3GB to use and whenever I run it, my pc straight up freezes and I have to force reboot it. 

If m stands for mb, then it needs anywhere more than 5GB memory currently. Please help me get it to consume 40GB+ memory.
