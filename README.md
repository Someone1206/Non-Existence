# Non-Existence
### The most useless repo on the internet.
---
This repo shares the depression I have (which is <5% of my depression). Yes if you are a programmer (for some reason unfortunately) then you'd be depressed if you look at the code.

You can use anything here provided that you don't use it to spread hate or harm others(dosen't apply to me).
