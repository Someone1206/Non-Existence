# If you can't understand wtf is going on, then don't worry cuz I don't know myself.

But am probably tryin' to build a log manager or so. Again Ik there are tons of software like that on the internet (which do the same fn, I am not tryin' to insult them) but go and read this carefully [My README](https://github.com/Someone1206/Someone1206/blob/main/README.md)

btw don't fu##ing tell to create another repo for this sh#*
